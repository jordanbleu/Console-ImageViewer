# Console-ImageViewer
Takes any image you throw at it and tries its best to replicate it in the Windows Console, using the 16 built in console colors.  Generally provides hilarious and awful results.


The program uses slightly flawed logic to find a color (which could be any of the 16 million supported colors) and out of its 16 supported console colors to replicate the image in a very low resolution image.  

This program is not useful in any way, but is an interesting concept.
